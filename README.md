# ONTOP iOS Assignment

Welcome to the ONTOP iOS developer candidate assignment.

Thanks for your interest in the ONTOP Team. You are just a couple of steps away from joining a world-class team of passionate professionals.
It is meant to help us determine what you focus on and your capabilities regarding the development of iOS native mobile applications in Swift.
This assignment should have an attached CSV file named ‘issues.csv’.

## Description
Create an app that can visualize the contents of the attached CSV file on the screen

## Requirements
1. Correctly implemented, at community widely recognized, architecture, design patterns, and technologies by your choice
2. UI thread is not blocked during file reading, parsing or content browsing
3. Focus on quality:
    * Code style and formatting
    * High cohesion of modules
    * Scalability without refactoring
    * Performance aspects
    * Unit Tests
    * No irrelevant or dead code
    * Code is concise, but production ready requiring no additional touches to code.
4. Ready for CSV files in size above 5MB
5. Ready for malformed content
6. The result should be delivered as a link or email attachment 

As a bonus, you can impress us with:
* Advanced setup of the project
* The CSV parser created by yourself
* Nice looking UI
* UI Tests
* File selector to avoid hard-coded paths and ease validation
* If a Git repository is provided it contains more than initial commit

### Developer Notes
* Use the most recently released version of Swift.
* Focus on iPhone only, but make sure it works properly for all supported device types & orientations.

## What will be assessed?
1. Functionality: the application has the functions described in the job and does not crash. Errors are handled properly *(weight 2)*
2. Quality of code: the code does not contain any design faults, is written in accordance with the conventions and standards, and is easy to read *(weight 3)*
3. Application Architecture: The application can be easily maintained and extended, there are clear layers visible, etc. *(weight 3)*
4. User Experience & UI Design: application is clear and easy to use (but no need to create some super-beautiful graphics, it’s more about the (auto-)layout and chosen components) *(weight 1.5)*
5. Library Selection: Selected 3rd party libraries (if any) should have a reasonable use case, and be of high quality *(weight 0.5)*

We look forward to reviewing your work. 

Good Luck!
